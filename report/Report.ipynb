    "elements equal to the pivot, and elements greater than the pivot. This is done in O(n) time. From this the array containing\n",
    "the kth element is chosen, based on where k is in relation to the pivot. This is done recursively and stops once the array is\n",

    "## Justification of correctness\n",
    "This algorithm solves this selection problem through recursion and maintance of the invariant. The \n",
    "invariant in this case is the medians. The first step is to divide the array into sublists of 5 \n",
    "elements each. This is done to ensure that we can find the median of each sublist in O(1) time. This\n",
    "allows us to take a median of medians, which will serve as the pivot point for the partitioning step.\n",
    "\n",
    "Partitioning results in an 3 arrays: elements less than, equal to, and greater than the pivot. From\n",
    "this the array that contains k is taken, based on its relation to the pivot, and the value of k is \n",
    "updated to reflect its original position in the new array.\n",
    "\n",
    "Loop invariant: the current array contains k (the original element to be selected)\n",
    "Base case: n < 5, where n = length of array, so the array can be sorted to find the kth element\n",
    "Inductive step: The inductive step will use strong induction to prove the loop invariant. Assume\n",
    "selection_recursive correctly partitions an array into a smaller one containing k, at any iteration i.\n",
    "Then, at i + 1, the array containing k is partitioned using the median of medians as a pivot to create\n",
    "3 arrays, containing elements less than, equal to, and greater than the pivot, respectively. From this, \n",
    "the array containing k is used for the next recursive step, which chosen by whether k is less than, \n",
    "equal to, or greater than the pivot. Thus, the new array contains k, so the loop invariant holds.\n",
    "Termination: since the array is partitioned into smaller arrays each step, n <= 5 will be true at some point.\n",
    "\n",
    "Thus, the algorithm correctly finds the kth element, as shown with the loop invariant and strong induction.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Recurrence relation of run time\n",
    "First, we have to analyze `PARTITION`. We can see that this function runs in $O(n)$ since we run through all elements `A`, which is length `n`.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now, starting in `SELECTION_RECURSIVE`, we can see that we first split the list into sublists, which takes $O(n)$ as we are going through all of `A`.\n",
    "\n",
    "Following that, the medians are calculated in $O(n)$ due to each sort taking place on at **most** 5 elements (since each sublist is), and therefore can be reduced to constant time. As we are sorting $n/5$ sublists, we get our $O(n)$.\n",
    "\n",
    "We get to our first recursive call for choosing the pivot. This call with be a \"conquer\" step, where we get $T(n/5)$, since medians is at that length.\n",
    "\n",
    "As stated above, `PARTITION` runs in $O(n)$, so we can keep going.\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, we get to a split of how the next and final recursive function is called. Considering this, we know that at least half of the medians are $\\ge$ than the median of medians (which is what we are looking for). Therefore, half of the n/5 blocks have at least 3 elements $\\ge$ median of medians, which gives us a split of 3n/10, with the other partition being the worst case of 7n/10.\n",
    "\n",
    "As such, our final recurrence is:  \n",
    "$T(n) = T(n/5) + T(7n/10) + O(n)$\n",
    "\n",
    "## Solution to the recurrence relation\n",
    "To solve this recurrence, we can employ a guess and check:  \n",
    "Guess: $T(n)\\in O(n)$  \n",
    "So: $T(n) \\le cn$  \n",
    "Assume: $T(n/5) + T(7n/10)\\le c\\frac{n}{5} + c\\frac{7n}{10}$  \n",
    "Then:  \n",
    "$T(n)\\le c\\frac{n}{5} + c\\frac{7n}{10}\\le cn$  \n",
    "$\\frac{9c}{10}\\le c$, which is true for all $c >= 0$\n",
    "\n",
    "Therefore, we have proven that $T(n) \\in O(n)$\n",
    "\n",
    "## Benchmarking results\n",
    "Our benchmarking covers different values of n with the same k and different values of k with\n",
    "the same n for our selection sort algorithm. All values in the array are randomly generated.\n",
    "Moreover, the brute force solution of sorting the entire array and selecting the k-1th element\n",
    "was also benchmarked, with different values of n and constant k. Since the k-1th element is \n",
    "being selected from a list, the value of k does not matter for this comparison. \n",

    "The times stay consistently around 9-10 seconds despite the different values of k, so k\n",
    "is not a variable in the asymptotic complexity.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "Next, different values of n are benchmarked for the same k. The choice of k for these tests does\n",
    "not matter, as shown by the previous results. The times increase linearly as sizes grow to higher\n",
    "powers of 10, justifying the O(n) complexity.\n",
