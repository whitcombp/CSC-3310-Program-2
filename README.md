# Program 2: Divide and Conquer

- [X] A paragraph describing the approach you will use to solve the problem. Provide at least 2 illustrations that explain the
approach.
- [X] High-level pseudocode for an algorithm that uses that rule to solve the computational problem for any input
- [X] An explanation and justification for why your algorithm is correct (1-3 paragraphs)
- [X] A table of your test cases, the answers you expect, and the answers returned by running your implementation of the
algorithm.
- [X] The derivation of a recurrence relation describing the run time in terms of the number of points n. (Show your work!)
You may assume that the random pivot divides the elements in half each time.
- [X] A solution to the recurrence relation (show your work). Ideally, you will get a run time in terms of O (n) in asymptotic
notation.
- [X] A table and graph from benchmarking different lists with different sizes and values of k. Benchmark your implementation
versus an approach that sorts the numbers and picks the element at index k âˆ’ 1. If the benchmarks do not support your
theoretically-derived run time and/or do not provide evidence that the run time of your algorithm grows more slowly than the sorting approach, this may indicate a flaw in your implementation.
- [X] An appendix containing all of your source code and test cases.
